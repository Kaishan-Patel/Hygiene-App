# Hygiene-App
A simple iOS app I made to display restaurant ratings withing a certain radius.

Installing
Click on Clone or download and open with Xcode. Save the file wherever you want and clone the application.
Once the application has loaded onto Xcode, click on 'No Scheme'--->'Manage Schemes...' which is located to the right of the STOP button at the top.
A window will appear, click on 'Autocreate Schemes Now' then you can close the window.
